**Chatbot using Gemini API – Project Description (200 Words):**

This project is a smart AI chatbot built using the Gemini API, which is part of Google’s powerful generative AI models. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries in natural language, offering human-like conversations across a wide range of topics. By integrating the Gemini API through an API key, the chatbot leverages Google's advanced language processing capabilities to generate intelligent, context-aware responses.

The application features a user-friendly interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to interact with the chatbot in real time. The backend is built using Node.js (or Python), which handles communication with the Gemini API securely. User messages are sent to the server, which forwards them to Gemini's language model and returns the AI-generated response to the frontend.

The chatbot is capable of maintaining the flow of conversation, offering relevant replies and supporting multi-turn dialogue. This makes it suitable for various use cases such as customer support, educational assistance, and virtual personal help.

The Gemini API key is securely managed to ensure authorized access, and measures like input validation and rate limiting are applied to maintain performance and prevent misuse. This project showcases the power of AI in enhancing digital interaction.
